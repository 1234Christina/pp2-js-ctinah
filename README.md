# The Loud House Quiz
My project is a True or False Quiz on The Loud House which is an animated cartoon TV series for kids. It allows a user to answer trivia questions based on the characters and their lives and relationships. The quiz can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, as can the tv series!

The deployed site can be seen here (link)

# Future Features

An option to allow the user to pick how many questions they want to answer eg 10, 20 or more

# Testing
I tested the quiz in different browsers (add screenshots)

I tested responsivity throughout development in Chrome Dev Tools
I tested all functions throughout development in the console

User testing - family and friends tested my quiz to ensure it was easy to use
I ensured to try diferent user actions to ensure no errors were caused by the code

## Bugs
### Solved bugs: 
Bug fix: my initial functions weren't displaying my questions as text in a html element, and drilling down into the object to get the text of the question solved the bug. I also needed to remove a line of code which was appending the question to the end of the document.
Bug fix: I mistakenly tried to put a function inside the DOM content loaded event listener which needed to be defined outside the listener.

# Credits
## Content 
The questions and answers were written by me and I carried out my own research by pulling information from the tv series episodes. 

Icons are taken from font awesome.
## Media 
The Loud House Logo was cut from a larger image found via google search

# UX/UI considerations
I searched google for fonts appropriate to and popular with kids. and I also looked for comic-book style/cartoon style fonts.
I searched font awesome icons to make the buttons more intuitive and interesting to children using the app and I added in titles for accessibility. 

I included wireframes of the design I had in mind.
