# The Loud House Quiz
My project is a True or False Quiz on The Loud House which is an animated cartoon TV series for kids. It allows a user to answer trivia questions based on the characters and their lives and relationships. The quiz can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, as can the tv series!

#### The deployed site can be seen [here](https://1234christina.github.io/pp2-js-ctinah/)

You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Alt text is a short text equivalent of the information in the image. Then, wrap the link for the image in parentheses ().

# Future Features
I would like to add a corresponding image with every question such as an image of each character.

I would add an option to allow the user to pick how many questions they want to answer eg 10, 20 or more.

# Testing
I tested the quiz in different browsers (add screenshots)

I tested responsivity throughout development in Chrome Dev Tools

I tested all functions throughout development in the console

User testing - family and friends tested my quiz to ensure it was easy to use
I ensured to try diferent user actions to ensure no errors were caused by the code

## Bugs
### Solved bugs: 
Bug fix: my initial functions weren't displaying my questions as text in a html element, and drilling down into the object to get the text of the question solved the bug. I also needed to remove a line of code which was appending the question to the end of the document.

Bug fix: I mistakenly tried to put a function inside the DOM content loaded event listener which needed to be defined outside the listener.

## Validator testing 
w3c jigsaw jshint 
## Lighthouse

The project performs well on Lighthouse testing.

# Deployment 
The site was deployed to Github Pages.
### The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repo navigate to the settings tab.

From the source section drop-down menu, select the master branch.

Then the page provides the link to the completed website.

# Credits
## Content 
The questions and answers were written by me and I carried out my own research by pulling information from the tv series episodes. 

Icons are taken from font awesome.
## Media 
The Loud House Logo was cut from a larger image found via google search

# UX/UI considerations
I searched google for fonts appropriate to and popular with kids. and I also looked for comic-book style/cartoon style fonts.

I searched font awesome icons to make the buttons more intuitive and interesting to children using the app and I added in titles for accessibility. 

I included wireframes of the design I had in mind.
